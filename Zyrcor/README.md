# Zyrcor Theme

This pice was made in 1989 as music for game I was working on, but which never
materialized. It uses a custom 68000 assembly music player.

## Building

The source code has been tested with Devpac Amiga 3.04. It is only required to
assemble "MusicPlayer.asm". The sound sample folder must be accessible from
"Zyrcor:Sounds/" (which is the case for the included disk image).
